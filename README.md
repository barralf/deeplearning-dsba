# Launchable via binder

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/barralf/deeplearning-dsba/master?urlpath=lab) : online Conda environment

Access this Binder at the following URL:

## Notes: Conda environment with environment.yml
This Binder-compatible repo works thanks to: 
- its ![Binder URL](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/barralf/deeplearning-dsba/master?urlpath=lab) rooting from this repo
- its `environment.yml` file 

The `environment.yml` file lists all Python libraries on which the notebook
depends, specified as though they were created using the following `conda` commands:
```
source activate example-environment
conda env export > environment.yml
```
Note that the only libraries available will be the ones specified in
the `environment.yml`, so be sure the file includes everything needed! ;)
